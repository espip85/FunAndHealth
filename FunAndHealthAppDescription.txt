The HealthAndFun application will display a wide variety of health providers around the world, allowing the user to get health treatment, compare prices worldwide, and at the same time, if desired, get to visit one touristic place either for the recovery process or before the surgery. 

The app will show the user the different options for different medical procedures in four health areas: dental care, esthetic procedures, eye care, and rest and recovery homes. After selecting the desired health area, the app will provide the user with different options in locations and costs. Afterwards, after choosing if one wants to visit a touristic place for recovering or for visiting before the health procedure, the application will show touristic options nearby to the location of the selected medical procedure, or within the country.
